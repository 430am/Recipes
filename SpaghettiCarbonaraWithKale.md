3. Add the kale and cook, stirring, until the kale wilts and begins to crisk, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Transfer kale, meat, and shallots to a bowl and set aside.
6. In the same pot, add the broth and pasta, and adjust heat to maintain a vigorous boil.

8. When the pasta is almost done, add the raw eggs, cheese, and black pepper to the kale and bacon mixture.
9. When the pasta is finished, remove from heat, add the kale mixture, and stir with a wooden spoon until thickened and creamy.
10. Season strongly with black pepper and serve immediately.
